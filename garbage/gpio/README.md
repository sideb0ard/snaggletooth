GPIO
====

####Libraries
We are using RPi.GPIO for basic IO
Potentially using https://github.com/sarfata/pi-blaster to PWM RC controllers like https://github.com/lawsonkeith/picar

####Files
helloblink.py blinks an LED to validate RPi.GPIO is installed and the pi is working correctly.
hellopwm.py fades up LEDs to validate pi-blaster is installed and is a reference script for PWM.
